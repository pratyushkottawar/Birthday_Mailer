  <p>
    On this auspicious day, when you are most merciful, we humbly pray at your feet for your <strong>guidance and blessings</strong>. 
    Your presence, wisdom, and constant encouragement have been the lifeline for our small Surbhikunj VOICE family 🌱.

    With your blessings, may we <strong>progress swiftly in Krishna consciousness</strong>, continue preaching with enthusiasm and humility, and strive to expand our Surbhikunj VOICE family multifold.

    We remain deeply grateful for all that you do and continue to pray that we stay under your shelter and service always 🙏.
